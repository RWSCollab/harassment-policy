    "text": "This policy is intended to preserve the dignity, respect and professionalism of the organization.  Organization is committed to providing an environment for our members, directors, officers, staff, volunteers and any persons served by organization (“Covered Persons”) that is comfortable, safe and free from harassment of any kind. Any type of harassment is a violation of this policy. Inappropriate conduct toward others is contrary to the values of the organization.\n\n\n\nHarassment is behavior that is of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as behavior intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive. In the legal sense, it is behavior which is found threatening or disturbing to a reasonable person. Harassment can be due to race, gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, and other unique or distinguishing characteristics. Harassment can take many forms.  It may be, but is not limited to, the following: words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation, physical contact, or violence. Sexual harassment may include unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature when such conduct creates an intimidating environment or prevents an individual from effectively performing the duties of their position, or when such conduct is made a condition of employment or compensation, either implicitly or explicitly.  It is not the intent of the behavior by the offender that determines if harassment has occurred, but whether the behavior is welcome by the receiver.\n\n\n\nA Covered Person is responsible for helping keep the work environment free of harassment, including the work environment of organization’s Covered Persons with whom there is contact.  This includes organization events. If any organization member becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, they shall report it to a member of the organization’s Steering Committee and/or Staff. Members have an affirmative duty to report potential violations of this Policy to the Steering Committee.\n\n\n\nAny Covered Person who believes that they have suffered harassment in violation of the Harassment Policy should take the following action:\n\nIf they are able to do so without conflict or danger, tell the harasser as clearly as possible that the behavior is unwelcome.\nThey may lodge a complaint with a member of the Steering Committee or Staff. They should clearly identify the behavior surrounding the complaint. They may remain anonymous if desired.\n\n\n\n\nThe organization, including all persons to whom a violation of the Harassment Policy has been reported and persons who have become aware of a complaint, must maintain confidentiality to the extent possible given the need to investigate.\n\n\n\nThe organization, or any director, officer or employee, may not retaliate against any victim or witness who reports a violation of this Harassment Policy. Any retaliation will be considered as harassment.\n\n\n\nAll complaints filed under the Policy will undergo a fair, complete and timely investigation, followed by a reasonable conclusion drawn from the evidence collected. The Steering Committee will take appropriate corrective action if misconduct is revealed.  Even a single incident of harassment may be grounds for the removal of an individual from their place within the organization membership. Harassment will also be considered grounds for firing staff or for terminating a contract as well as banning them from future organization events.\n\n\n\n\nA lodged complaint will be initially reviewed by the Director and Steering Committee, unless one of the aforementioned is the reason for the complaint. If the threat is immediate, they will take steps to remove the alleged offender from the premises. The alleged offender may appeal the decision.\nUpon request for an appeal, the alleged offender will choose one Steering Committee member and the organization will choose one Steering Committee member along with the organization Coordinator to form a panel to review the decision. Their decision is final.\nNone of these steps preclude the complainant from taking legal action."
